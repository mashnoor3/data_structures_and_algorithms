Problem Name:  476. Number Complement

Problem:
Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Solution:
Convert the integer to binary, this will be a stack.
XOR every bit (digit) oin the binary number (stack).
Convert from binary back to decimal.

Time complexity: O(log(n))
Space complexity: O(1)
